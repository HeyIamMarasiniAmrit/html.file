  <p><h5> love wordPress. In 2015 AD, I joined the 'community' and self-taught myself to make minor twearks and customizations in someone ele's themes. After a few months i was building my own themes and four years later i build websites entirely on WordPress. And, i have contributed my knowledge as a Theme Reviewer in WordPress Community.</h5></p> </div>
